## 🧠 How It Works

- The game uses **Pygame** to create a grid-based canvas.  
- The snake moves based on the last direction key pressed.  
- On hitting a wall, the snake **bounces back** (up to 3 times).  
- Eating food causes the snake to **grow longer**.  
- Reach **15 blocks in length** to win the game.  
- Hit walls more than 3 times — **Game Over**.
